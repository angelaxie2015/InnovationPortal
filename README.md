# Innovation Portal

Innovation Portal is a web application built with MERN for the UF Innovation Ambassador Club as a project for the class CEN3031 - Software Engineering.

## Features
Innovation Portal allows UF IA ambassadors to post and attend events, admins to view event attendance and delete events, and non-ambassadors to view events, contact an ambassador, and view FAQ questions. 

## Stack
In addition to MERN, Innovation Portal also uses Material-UI components to build the front end as well as GridFS for uploading images.
